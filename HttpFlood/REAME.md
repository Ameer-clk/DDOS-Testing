HTTP Flood:  

README

Description:
This script enables flooding a target URL with a specified number of requests, each separated by a specified delay time. It can be utilized for testing server resilience and response handling under high traffic conditions.

Usage:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```
 pip install requests

```

3. Run the script from the command line with the desired parameters:

```
python script.py https://example.com/api 100 0.5

```

- <target_url>: The URL of the target server or endpoint to flood.
- <request_count>: The number of requests to send to the target URL.
- <delay_time>: The delay time (in seconds) between each request.

This command will flood the URL "https://example.com/api" with 100 requests, each separated by a 0.5-second delay.

Notes:
- Use this script responsibly and only on URLs you have permission to test.
- Flooding a server with requests can cause network congestion and disrupt service. Exercise caution.
- The script uses a default User-Agent header to mimic a typical web browser. You may adjust it as needed.
