This is a simple Python script to flood a target URL with HTTP GET requests using multiple threads.

## Usage

1. Install the required library:

   ```

Copy the flood.py script to your project directory.

Modify the script to set target_url to the URL you want to flood and num_threads to the desired number of threads.

```
python httpflood.py

```


Parameters
target_url: The URL you want to flood.
